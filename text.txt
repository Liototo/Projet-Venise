This fanciful treatment oflberian history concerns the end ofthe Visigoths' reign but contrasts sharply
with David's text, set by Pollarolo as 1692/10. Roderic/Rodrigo, the last Gothic king to rule Spain,
seduced the young noblewoman Florinda with the promise of marriage. Upon the death of the ruler
Wittiza/Vitige, Roderic succeeded to the Spanish throne [71 0-711]. The future of Spain was thought
to depend upon the son to whom Florinda gave birth.285 The action took place in Seville.
0 © I! duello must have opened prior to 31 December 1699 because a report of2 January 1700 said that
it was enjoying "applause" (M). The libretto had been dedicated on 26 December. On 16 January 1699
M.V. (M), it was said to be the best-attended work of the season. The cast-list given in the libretto
indicates the dominance of singers from the Mantuan court- Maria Landini (Elisena ), Anna [Maria]
Battaglia ( Climene), Margherita Raimondi (Florinda), and Filippo Sandri (Giuliano). The role ofRodrigo
was taken by Nicola Grimaldi (from the vice-regal chapel at Naples), who was appearing in his Venetian
debut. 286 That of the son ofWittiza (Evanco) was sung by Oliviero Matraia from the vice-regal chapel
in Sicily. Paolo Teodorovich appeared in a minor role.
Ziani's work was given in Mantua in the spring of 1701. Silvani's text was adapted for Handel's first
Italian opera, now known as Rodrigo but first given with the title Vincer se stesso ela maggior vittoria
(HWV 5) for the Accademia degl'lnfuocati, which met in the civic theater on the Via del Cocomero
(Florence) late in 1707. It was set as Li sdegni cangiati per amore (San Moise, 1725/4).
